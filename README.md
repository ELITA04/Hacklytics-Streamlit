# Mood Boost 🧠😊

**Mood Boost helps users navigate through their lows and celebrate their highs.**

## Inspiration ✨

The year of 2020 will go down in history as one of the worst year for positive mental well-being. More than 43% of people surveyed by the US Census Bureau in December 2020 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. That is more than 31% of people who reported these symptoms than in the previous year. Mental illness is a leading cause to chronic physical health problems and we want to change this. Our goal is to help individuals improve their mental health during the Covid-19 crisis.

## What it does 🤔

Mood Boost uses voice analysis to detect the users ongoing mood. When a negative mood such as anger is detected, Mood Boost will notify the user and display a positive message as well as lead the user to resources that will boost their mood! When a positive mood such as excitement is detected, Mood Boost will celebrate this positivity with the user.

## What’s next for Mood Boost 

In the long term, Mood Boost will be in the form of a bracelet which will send vibrations to notify the user when a negative mood is detected as well as display positive messages. It will also be able to track ongoing mood changes so users can view the fluctuations in their mood.
